My first Python Project using Keras and TensorFlow

This project takes in words from given train and text files. They are desialized using the Pickle library so that they can be used in the program. This program then tokenizes these words and with the use of the various modules of the Keras and TensorFlow library, the program is then made to learn how to respond to questions asked using these words, based on stories that have been input by the user, using these words.

At the end, we look at the acuracy of answers by using the test data, and we also try and get an answer of a question based on the story we have input ourselves.
